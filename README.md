Base.css v1.1.0
===================

A set of base styles used as a foundation for modular architected CSS.

It uses normalize.css v1.1.2 from [Nicolas Gallagher](http://github.com/necolas)
and [Jonathan Neal](http://github.com/jonathantneal) as a base.

From there, basic formatting styles are added for common elements.

Base.css also includes print styles, based on the concept from [Jordan Moore](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/post/30308855354/where-print-fits-in-responsive-web-design).
